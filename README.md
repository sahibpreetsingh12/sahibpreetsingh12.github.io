## 👋 Hey there!

I'm a GenAI Consultant at CGI who loves building AI systems that don't just work in demos, but scale in the real world. When I'm not architecting RAG pipelines or optimizing tokenizers, you'll find me sharing what I learn on LinkedIn and mentoring the next generation of AI engineers.

**What gets me excited:**
- 🤖 Building **Agentic AI systems** that solve actual business problems
- 📊 **LLM Evaluation** - because "it looks good" isn't a metric
- ⚡ **Tokenizer optimization** and the fascinating world of fertility rates
- 🛠️ **Production ML** - from Jupyter notebooks to enterprise deployments
- 📚 **Knowledge sharing** - turning complex AI concepts into digestible content

---

## 🔥 Current Adventures

```bash
# At CGI, architecting the future
$ az ml agentic-rag deploy --value="700K USD project" --efficiency="+65%"
$ databricks cluster optimize --speed-improvement="31%" --framework="pyspark"

# In my spare time, exploring the edges
$ python -m research.tokenizer_fertility --subwords-per-token="fascinating"
$ streamlit run llm_evaluation_framework.py --beyond-accuracy=true
```

Recently shipped **Resume-2-ResumeRAG** - a GenAI product that went from idea to $15K revenue boost using fine-tuned LLMs, custom RAG, and good old Docker + AWS ECS.

## 🧠 What I'm Building With

**The AI Stack I Live In:**
```python
# The classics that never get old
ml_core = ["PyTorch", "Transformers", "Scikit-Learn", "Langchain", "LlamaIndex"]

# Where the magic happens in production  
agentic_frameworks = ["CrewAI", "Langgraph", "Autogen", "Pydantic"]
cloud_native = ["Azure Promptflow", "Databricks", "PySpark", "AWS ECS"]

# For when you need to go deeper
optimization = ["Triton", "CUDA kernels", "Quantization", "KV-cache tricks"]
```

**Infrastructure & Tools:**
- ☁️ **Azure**: Promptflow, Blob Storage, Key Vault, AI Search  
- 🚀 **AWS**: ECS, Lambda, SageMaker, S3
- 🗄️ **Data**: SQL Server, MongoDB, CosmosDB, Neo4j
- 🐳 **DevOps**: Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions

## 📝 Knowledge Lab

This site is my digital lab notebook where I document the journey from "Hey, this LLM thing is cool" to "Here's how we deployed it at enterprise scale without breaking everything."

**Recent deep dives:**
- 🔬 **Fertility of Tokenizers** - Why subword counts matter more than you think
- 🎯 **LLM Evaluation Beyond Accuracy** - Metrics that actually predict user satisfaction
- ⚡ **Scikit-LLM Integration** - Making advanced language models play nice with sklearn
- 🤖 **Agentic RAG in Production** - Multi-agent systems that don't fall apart under load

## 💭 Philosophy

> *"You have to put the work in, to get the work out."*

I believe the best AI systems come from understanding both the theory and the production realities. Whether it's figuring out why your tokenizer is producing too many subwords or debugging why your RAG system hallucinates on edge cases - the devil is always in the details.
