Starting from start month of July-2025 super scared and tensed. I was doing everything left right and centre to secure a job and in the middle of all this felt super helpless and during that time only got the hit to make myself learn something which I always feared GPU programming. Yes actually how GPU's can be made to work and understand the depth of how things work and not just **.cuda()** and work done.

Truly saying, Since I was new made a choice to teach myself CUDA but after couple of weeks motivation died a slow death just because it was too time consuming. Then came to my mind the name of **Unsloth** and how they made use of **Triton** for making our beloved LLM's faster and smaller by programming things in **Triton** and this is exactly was my first motivation to learn Triton.

### The Hard Part
The hard part of learning Triton was not the language but the ceremony around it and lack of structured resources around it. ChatGPT and Claude were my two partners.

Enough of back story and I feel I have explained how i got started. Let's see why it matters for you(The Honest Answer) :-

Look, I won't sell you dreams. Triton isn't going to magically 10x your career overnight. But here's what it actually did for me: it removed the fear. That intimidating gap between "I use PyTorch" and "I understand what my GPU is doing"? Triton atleast helps to bridge that.
