## 2. Bullet Point Improvements

**Current Issues:**
- Mixed `-` and `*` bullets
- Inconsistent numbering
- Some bullets should be regular paragraphs

**Recommendations:**

### Use `-` for simple lists:
```markdown
- Kernel crashes immediately and gives Bad memory Error
- Reads garbage memory and gives wrong results
```

### Use numbered lists for steps/sequences:
```markdown
1. BLOCK_SIZE must be power of 2
2. Always use masks to prevent crashes
3. Use triton.cdiv for proper grid sizing
```

### Use `*` for nested sub-points:
```markdown
- Team 0 (pid=0) goes to Section A
  * Handles packages 0-999
  * Uses program_id(0) to identify
- Team 1 (pid=1) goes to Section B
  * Handles packages 1000-1999
```

## 3. Specific Fixes Needed

**Grammar fixes:**
- "fucntions" → "functions"
- "pactising" → "practicing" 
- "Remeber" → "Remember"
- "obsevations" → "observations"

**Structure fixes:**
- Move "Why You Should Learn" into proper subsections
- Break up the long warehouse analogy into clearer sections
- Add more descriptive headers for the code walkthrough

**Formatting fixes:**
- Consistent bullet style throughout
- Better spacing between sections
- Clear separation between concept explanation and code examples
